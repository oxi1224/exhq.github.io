i didnt have energy for anything fancy so if you wanna read this you gotta get used to this style ig <br> <br> <br>
sometimes i feel like the world doesnt want me to feel better, i dont really believe in karma or god, its just me having shit RNG, i wish i could reset <br>
im trying my best to feel better, im trying everything i could but nothing works, its painful. it hurts me. all i want is to have a happy life with nothing to worry about <br>
i got in a taxi today cus i was late and had to get to my work in time, i had 0.5$ short of what i had to give, the driver got really angry at me. started to call me really mean names and not being nice. i couldnt do anything to protect myself. <br>
i shouldve just stopped at an atm, i shouldnt have gotten into the taxi. its my fault. im weak, a piece of shit. i couldnt protect myself, couldnt think straight, couldnt be useful. <br>
if only i could be useful to anyone, just once. i want to acompolish something, i wanna be something, anything <br>
i feel guilty for bothering nea everyday, its like she has to pay for my loneliness. i dont wanna be a bother, i was just excited to have a friend, im sorry nea, ill try my best to not be a piece of shit and annoy you anymore. <br>
i just want a hug. i dont deserve it i know but i just want a comfort zone, someone i can mald to, someone who gives a shit. <br>
i was just trying to be nice to nick, i tried my best, he doesnt accept my friendship. i just wanted a friend <br> <br>
i, echo, zak, mel, whatever the fuck you wanna call me, am the equivalent of downbad. <br>
a lonely, fucked up piece of shit. downbad for a hug, a friend, anything calming <br>
sorry for wasting your time on this, you should go do something useful
